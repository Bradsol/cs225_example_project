Gcevans successfully finished writing the skip table for KMP algorithm.
Bradsol was tasked with writing tests but the written tests did not pass the algorithm.

### Plans for next week
Determine whether the tests or the code is wrong.
Write additional tests
Start working on the KMP algorithm. We will begin by writing a visual example of the algorithm (on whiteboard) to make sure we understand the method. We dont plan to actually begin implementing the algorithm next week.

### Questions for Mentor
Is this real life? Is this just fantasy?
