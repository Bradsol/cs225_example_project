### Tasks Complete

### Issues encountered (Questions for mentors)

### Plans for next week


Example:

## September 17 2023

### Goals 
1. Finish coding preprocessing function for algorithm (Completed)
2. Create more tests for preprocessing function to prove correctness (Not completed)

### Tasks Complete
Gcevans successfully finished writing the skip table for KMP algorithm.
Bradsol was tasked with writing tests but the written tests did not pass the algorithm.

### Issues encountered (Questions for mentors)
The preprocessing function keeps running out of memory on full scale tests. We benchmarked our table and it stores our dataset in N^5 space for N sequences. Do you know of any way we can store a text file in space better than N^5?

### Plans for next week
Determine whether the tests or the code is wrong.
Write additional tests
Start working on the KMP algorithm. We will begin by writing a visual example of the algorithm (on whiteboard) to make sure we understand the method. We dont plan to actually begin implementing the algorithm next week.
